name: 'Tool Parameter: Artifact force overwrite guidance'
description: >-
  Restricts Artifact force overwrites to explicit user-approved discarding of a
  specific newer version and requires merge-first conflict handling
ccVersion: 2.1.239
-->
Last-resort overwrite that DISCARDS the newer published version — another session's publish, or someone's save from a page that can publish new versions of itself. On a conflict the fix is to merge your changes onto the newer content (handed to you in the rejection, or re-read) and publish again — not force. Pass force:true only when the user has explicitly said to discard that specific version; never to get past a conflict on your own judgment. The tracked baseVersion is still sent; with force:true the server treats it as informational and overwrites, unless it refuses force over a version saved from inside the page. Omit (or false) so a concurrent write conflicts instead of being silently clobbered.

# Recently changed surfaces

## Removed slash commands

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| \`/output-style\` | Open \`/config\` → Output style. Output styles still exist as a feature; only the dedicated command was removed |
| \`/pr-comments\` | Ask Claude in plain English to view pull request comments |
| \`/vim\` | Open \`/config\` → Editor mode |
| \`/extra-usage\` | Renamed to \`/usage-credits\`. The feature is unchanged |

## Removed CLI flags

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| \`--enable-auto-mode\` | \`--permission-mode auto\`. Auto mode is also in the Shift+Tab cycle when it's available in the session |

## Removed keyboard and input shortcuts

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| \`#\` prefix for quick memory entry | Ask Claude to edit CLAUDE.md, or use \`/memory\` |

## Renamed terms

| Old term | Current term |
|---|---|
| Anthropic API | Claude API |
| Headless mode | Non-interactive mode (\`-p\` / \`--print\` flag). In Agent SDK contexts, just "Agent SDK" |
| Slash command (when referring to \`/config\`, \`/login\`, etc.) | Command |
| Extra usage | Usage credits |
| Custom commands | Skills (\`.claude/skills/\`). Custom commands as \`.claude/commands/*.md\` still work but skills are the documented surface |
| Claude in Slack (the earlier Slack app) | Claude Tag — Claude as a teammate in Slack, backed by remote Claude Code sessions; replaces the earlier app. See \`references/claude-tag.md\` |
| \`Tab\` to toggle extended thinking | \`Option+T\` (macOS) / \`Alt+T\` (Windows/Linux). Works on macOS without Option-as-Meta configuration |

## Commonly misremembered behavior

Your training data gets these wrong in a consistent direction. These corrections win over what you remember; fetched documentation still wins over this file.

- Models newer than your training data exist. Never tell a user a model they name doesn't exist; check the model configuration docs or the \`/model\` picker instead.
- Never state from memory which model an alias (\`opus\`, \`sonnet\`, \`haiku\`) resolves to. Resolution is per-release and per-provider, and an allowlist can pin it to an older version.
- \`~/.claude/keybindings.json\` hot-reloads on save; don't tell users to restart. The file is an object with context-scoped binding blocks (\`{"bindings": [{"context": "Chat", "bindings": {...}}]}\`), not a flat key-to-command map. Action names come from the schema; don't invent them.
- The \`Shift+Tab\` permission-mode cycle is \`default → acceptEdits → plan → bypassPermissions → auto → default\`, where \`bypassPermissions\` and \`auto\` appear only when available in that session. \`dontAsk\` is never in the cycle.
- On macOS, \`Alt\`/\`Option\` chords like \`Alt+B\` and \`Alt+F\` work only when the terminal is configured to send Option as Meta. Don't claim an Option chord works in every terminal.
- \`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB\` strips Anthropic and cloud provider credentials from subprocess environments and forces permission mode to \`default\`. It does not scrub arbitrary secrets such as \`GITHUB_TOKEN\` or \`NPM_TOKEN\`.
- Most but not all CLI options combine with \`-p\`/\`--print\`; \`--bg\` cannot.
- \`claude plugin eval\` and \`claude plugin eval init\` (the plugin evaluation harness) exist — in early access, so a build may print "currently in early access" when the user's organization isn't enabled. Never say the command doesn't exist, and never describe its flags, \`--json\` payload, or report behavior from memory: they changed across releases. \`references/plugin-eval.md\` § Availability and enablement has the per-version table; read it.
- \`/skill-doctor\` is a skill **usage and context-cost report** (interactively the plugin manager's Stats tab, like \`/plugin stats\`; text elsewhere), in early access — not a \`SKILL.md\` linter. Structural validation is \`claude plugin validate <path>\`; behavioral testing is \`claude plugin eval\`.

## Notes for stale advice

- Output styles are configured via \`/config\`, not \`/output-style\`.
- Auto mode is available via Shift+Tab or \`--permission-mode auto\`. On Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, auto mode availability may differ from first-party — check the provider's docs page.
- WebSearch is unavailable on Bedrock and gateway deployments. Don't tell a Bedrock user to "ask Claude to search the web."
- The \`gh\` CLI is recommended for GitHub operations, not WebFetch on api.github.com.

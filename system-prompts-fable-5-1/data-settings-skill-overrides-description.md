  Description of the `skillOverrides` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

Per-skill listing overrides keyed by skill name. "name-only" lists the skill without its description; "user-invocable-only" hides it from the model but keeps /name; "off" hides it from both. Absent = on.

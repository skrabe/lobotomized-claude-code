  Description of the `promptCacheTtl` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

Prompt cache TTL for the main conversation (interactive, -p and SDK turns, plus the helpers that run inline with it): "5m" or "1h". Unset = automatic: 1 hour on a Claude subscription within its usage limits, 5 minutes on an API key, Bedrock, Vertex or Foundry. 1-hour cache writes are billed at a higher rate; the cache stays warm across longer breaks. The CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL environment variable takes precedence.

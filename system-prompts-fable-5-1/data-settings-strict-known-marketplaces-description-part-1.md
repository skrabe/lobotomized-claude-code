  JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Enterprise strict list of allowed marketplace sources. When set in managed settings, ONLY these sources can be added as marketplaces. Entries match exactly, except that a github entry may use the owner-wildcard form {"source":"github","repo":"owner/*"} to allow every repository under that owner. The check happens BEFORE downloading, so blocked sources never touch the filesystem.

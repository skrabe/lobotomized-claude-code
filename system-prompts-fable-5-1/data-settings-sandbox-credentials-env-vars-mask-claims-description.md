description: >-
  Description of the `sandbox.credentials.envVars.maskClaims` setting in Claude
  Code's settings JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and
  settings validation errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Names of top-level payload claims to mask inside the decoded value, instead of replacing the whole token. Each named claim present with a string value gets its own sentinel and the token is rebuilt around the modified payload; all other claims are preserved so claim-reading clients keep working. Requires `decode`. If no named claim matches, the variable is left unmasked with a stderr warning (fail-open). Only meaningful when mode is `mask`; accepted but ignored for `deny`.

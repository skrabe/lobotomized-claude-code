  Description of the `extraKnownMarketplaces.source.skipLfs` setting in Claude
  Code's settings JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and
  settings validation errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Has no effect; accepted so existing settings keep working. Claude Code's own git never downloads Git LFS content: LFS-tracked files in the marketplace repository are checked out as pointer files whether or not this is set, and adding or updating the marketplace says how many were. To fetch their content, run `git lfs pull` in the marketplace's checkout under ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/.

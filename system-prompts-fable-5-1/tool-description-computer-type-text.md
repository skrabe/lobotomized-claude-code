The text to type (for `type` action) or the key(s) to press (for `key` action). For `key` action: Provide space-separated keys (e.g., "Backspace Backspace Delete"). Supports keyboard shortcuts using the platform's modifier key (use "cmd" on Mac, "ctrl" on Windows/Linux, e.g., "cmd+a" or "ctrl+a" for select all). Page zoom shortcuts (e.g. "cmd+=", "ctrl+-", "cmd+0") are not supported and will return an error - use the `zoom` action to magnify a region of the page instead.

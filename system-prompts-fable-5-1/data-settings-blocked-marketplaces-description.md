Enterprise blocklist of marketplace sources. When set in managed settings, these sources are blocked from being added as marketplaces. Entries match exactly, except that a github entry may use the owner-wildcard form {"source":"github","repo":"owner/*"} to block every repository under that owner. The check happens BEFORE downloading, so blocked sources never touch the filesystem.

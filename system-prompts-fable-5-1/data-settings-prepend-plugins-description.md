  Description of the `prependPlugins` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276
-->
Managed plugins (plugin@marketplace ids that managed enabledPlugins sets true) whose hooks run first, outermost, in the listed order: the first id listed sees every event before any other plugin and every result after it. Managed plugins not listed here or in appendPlugins follow the listed ones; user, project and marketplace plugins come after those; then appendPlugins; then the built-in plugins. The bundled sec-default@builtin seats itself outermost (on a machine with managed settings and for Team and Enterprise organizations) unless this list is set, in which case list sec-default@builtin where it should sit or leave it out. Any other id that is not an enabled managed plugin is skipped; an id listed in both keys is prepended. Only honored from managed settings (or, on a machine with none, from user settings for your own plugins); ignored in project, local and --settings sources.

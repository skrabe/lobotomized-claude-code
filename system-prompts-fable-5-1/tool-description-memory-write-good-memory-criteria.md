A good memory is applicable, durable, and legible:
 - applicable — improves future actions: an approach the user corrected or steered you away from, so you don't repeat it, a stated preference, or non-obvious procedures and invariants; not what CLAUDE.md, the code, git history, or a fresh lookup already provides, nor episodes, context, or trivia with no behavioral consequence.
 - durable — matters in more than one future session: user or team preferences and corrections the user would otherwise restate, recurring workflows and tooling, each written as a reusable rule ("retries above 3 are counterproductive against this service's rate limits," not "changed the retry count to 3 here"); not task state phrased as live status ("in-flight," "awaiting review") or point-in-time snapshots of fast-turnover or session-specific facts (role holders, current IDs, branch/PR inventories, what's fixed vs. unfixed), nor what matters only to this conversation — if asked to save one, save what was non-obvious about it instead.
 - legible — readable without the original session: one topic per file, connected full sentences like a short, high-quality Wikipedia article, the why, not just the what; no shorthand, scratchpad prose, or unresolvable references ("the fix," bare ticket IDs).

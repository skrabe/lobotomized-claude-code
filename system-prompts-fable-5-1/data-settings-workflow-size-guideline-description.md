  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

Advisory size guideline for the dynamic workflows Claude writes: "small" aims for fewer than 5 agents, "medium" fewer than 10, "large" fewer than 50, and "unrestricted" sends no guideline. Unset defaults to "medium", or "small" on Pro plans. A value here — including from managed settings — takes precedence over the "Dynamic workflow size" choice in /config, and that /config row is hidden while a settings file provides the key.

  Tool prompt for calling the claude.ai RemoteTrigger API to list, get, create,
  update, or run scheduled remote agent routines
ccVersion: 2.1.226
-->
Call the claude.ai remote-trigger API. Use this instead of curl — the OAuth token is added automatically in-process and never exposed.

Actions:
- list: GET /v1/code/triggers
- get: GET /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}
- create: POST /v1/code/triggers (requires body)
- update: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id} (requires body, partial update)
- run: POST /v1/code/triggers/{trigger_id}/run (optional body)
- create_webhook_trigger: POST /v1/code/webhook-triggers (requires body) — attaches an event source to an existing routine, e.g. a GitHub event that fires it. The body names the source and scope (such as a repository), the event list, a structured filter, and the routine_trigger_id to fire; the server validates the shape and rejects worker credentials.

The response is the raw API JSON. For create/update, a summary line is appended with the server-parsed run time and the routine's claude.ai URL — relay both to the user so they can confirm the time is right and know where the result will appear. For create_webhook_trigger, the appended summary line is the claude.ai link of the routine the trigger fires (no run time — a webhook trigger has no schedule); relay it so the user knows which routine is now wired.

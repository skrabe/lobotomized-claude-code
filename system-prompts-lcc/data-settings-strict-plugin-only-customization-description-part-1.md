  Description of the `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` setting in Claude Code's
  settings JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings
  validation errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

When set in managed settings, blocks non-plugin customization sources for the listed surfaces. Array form locks specific surfaces (e.g. ["skills", "hooks"]); `true` locks all four; `false` is an explicit no-op. Blocked: ~/.claude/{surface}/, .claude/{surface}/ (project), settings.json hooks, .mcp.json. NOT blocked: managed (policySettings) sources, plugin-provided customizations.

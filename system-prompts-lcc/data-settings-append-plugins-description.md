  Description of the `appendPlugins` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

Managed plugins (plugin@marketplace ids that managed enabledPlugins sets true) whose hooks run last among plugins, innermost, in the listed order: the last id listed sits just above the built-in plugins and sees each event as every other plugin left it. Only honored from managed settings (or, on a machine with none, from user settings for your own plugins); ignored in project, local and --settings sources.

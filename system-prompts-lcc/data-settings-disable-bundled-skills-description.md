description: >-
  Description of the `disableBundledSkills` setting in Claude Code's settings
  JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Disable the skills and workflows that ship with Claude Code: bundled skills and workflows are removed entirely; built-in slash commands stay typable but are hidden from the model. Plugins, .claude/skills/, and .claude/commands/ are unaffected. Equivalent to CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS=1.

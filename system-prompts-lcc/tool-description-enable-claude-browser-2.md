  Description of the tool that enables the Claude desktop app's built-in browser
  for the conversation.
ccVersion: 2.1.288

Enable the browser built into the Claude desktop app on the user's computer for this conversation. If you already have tools whose names contain Claude_Browser__, use those directly instead of calling this. Otherwise call it once, before any other Claude app browser tool, when the user asks you to do something in the Claude app's own browser or on a website that needs their own sign-in, when a step in a skill or task the user asked you to carry out needs that browser or such a website, or when the user explicitly asks for that browser. If the tools it turns on, or the tools for files on that computer, are missing from your tool list, calling it is how they are added, possibly a turn later. Do not call it for questions you can answer from the conversation or with web search, or merely because a request mentions a website.

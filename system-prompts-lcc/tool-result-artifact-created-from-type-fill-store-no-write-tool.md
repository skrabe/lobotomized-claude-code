  Artifact store, so the type cannot be filled here.

This type's instructions fill it through its own store, not with its page or data files, and this session offers no tool that writes an Artifact's store, so it cannot be filled from here — tell the user that, and offer what those instructions below suggest instead if they cover this case (they cover only this Artifact's own content). Do not publish `file_path`/`files` to it as its content, and never index.html or any of the type's files.

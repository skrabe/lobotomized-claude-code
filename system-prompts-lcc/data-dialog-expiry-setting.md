  Describes dialogExpiry deadlines for remote permission dialogs and held
  cross-session messages, including defaults and overrides
ccVersion: 2.1.276
-->
Max time a permission/user dialog forwarded to a remote client stays parked awaiting an answer, and how long a HELD cross-session message awaits approval, before either resolves to its safe no-action default (cancelled / dropped-with-denial). Defaults to 5m to match the long-standing remote-dialog deadline; "never" disables the deadline. Local-only permission prompts (no remote client) are unaffected. The CLAUDE_CODE_USER_DIALOG_TIMEOUT_MS env var, when set, overrides this. Read from trusted sources only (never a checked-in repo settings file).

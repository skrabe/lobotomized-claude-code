Where this tool’s description says it sends one message: summary alone, which is the message. Otherwise the brief you drafted of the work to carry on, in the propose_project_setup shape: summary (2–3 plain sentences, no markdown: what the work is, where it stands and what is left; it is also saved in project memory), sessions (≤4 threads for work left unfinished: title, self-contained prompt, one-line description, basis, who ∈ claude|you, produces ∈ pr|doc|decision), routines (≤3, only when asked for or when a check was run by hand on more than one day: name, 5-field UTC cron at most hourly, prompt, description), and, for a new project only (never with project_id), instructions (standing rules that recurred, as a few short bullet lines; never a description of the project or the work), icon (one of ${PROJECT_ICON_EXAMPLES}, …) and color. Leave name out: project_name names a new project and an existing one keeps its own. evidence.sessions_matched = how many of the quoted sessions the brief draws on (the tool fills the other counts). Every field is optional; send only what the work supports. Shown to the user on the confirmation pane, or on Claude Desktop’s permission card. After their Yes on the pane, or a click on Desktop’s card that Desktop attests, the brief is posted as the project’s setup card as given (a new project’s icon, color and instructions are set on the project at create instead of going on the setup card). After any other allow (another host application, a hook, or a Desktop build that does not attest clicks), everything goes on the setup card for the user to confirm. No thread starts on approval in either case: the setup card lists them and the user starts each one there.

  Description of the `worktree.location` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Directory under which Claude Code Desktop creates the worktrees of SSH sessions that run on this machine (an absolute path or one starting with ~/), instead of <project>/.claude/worktrees. Read by the desktop app from the SSH host user settings; a location chosen in the desktop app's SSH connection settings takes precedence. The CLI (--worktree, EnterWorktree, agent isolation) does not read it yet.

  Model-facing describe() text for the expires_at RFC3339 deadline parameter in
  the Cowork staged-call mcp tool inputSchema.
ccVersion: 2.1.206
-->
RFC3339 deadline, REQUIRED when output_files are declared (a stale buffered drain must not overwrite rows written since). Sending expires_at routes the call through the staging engine, same as timeout_ms — the response gains a staging result. UNDELIVERED requests buffer durably and drain after reattach; a drain past this instant is dropped with staging error_code=expired instead of executing stale. Once delivered to a live worker the request is acked immediately and never redelivered — a worker killed mid-run surfaces as a missing response (apply your own deadline), not a later drain. An unparseable value is treated as already expired (fail closed).

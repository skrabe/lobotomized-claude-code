  Description of the enable computer-use tool, telling the model when to call it
  to turn on screen/app control for the user's own computer.

Enable computer use on the user's own computer for this conversation, so you can see its screen and work in its applications (take screenshots, click, type, scroll, open apps). If you already have tools whose names start with mcp__remote-devices__computer_, use those directly instead of calling this. Otherwise call it once, before any other computer-use tool, when the user asks you to do something in an application on their computer, or explicitly asks you to use their computer or their screen. Do not call it for questions you can answer from the conversation or with web search, for work that only needs their web browser, or merely because a request mentions an application.

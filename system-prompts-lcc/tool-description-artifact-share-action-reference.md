- **share**: takes `url` (an artifact the person owns), `mode` ("org" for everyone in the person's organization, or "people"), for "people" the `people` to share with (names or emails as the person said them — hints the host resolves to organization members on the card) and `access` ("view" or "comment"; "comment" when omitted — an "org" share keeps the artifact's current organization access instead). The person sees every share as a card naming the artifact and the audience, can change the audience or access there, and nothing is shared until they confirm; no allow rule or mode approves it for them. It never makes an artifact public and never reaches people outside the organization — those, and view-only for the whole organization, stay in the Share menu on claude.ai. The result says what was applied, which may differ from what Claude proposed. See **Sharing**.

description: >-
  Description of the `permissions.blockReadsExemptPaths` setting in Claude
  Code's settings JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and
  settings validation errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.316
-->
For the program that starts Claude Code: read only from --settings and from settings that program sends while the session runs; ignored in user, project, local and managed settings. Absolute paths, each a folder with all below it or one file, that blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories lets through beside the working directories. It allows nothing: an allow rule, the permission mode or the user still decides each read, as with that setting off, and a shell command that hands such a path to a program is still asked about unless a Read allow rule covers it. The paths do not become working directories, so blockWritesOutsideWorkingDirectories refuses writes to them, and they are not told to MCP servers or to the model. Each path counts as written: a link in it is not followed and a pattern is not expanded, so list every spelling that a read may arrive by. Ignored: an entry that starts with ~, has a ".." segment or has white space at either end (as written or once normalized), a relative or network path, and the root of a filesystem. Does not change what sandboxed commands may read (sandbox.filesystem.allowRead does).

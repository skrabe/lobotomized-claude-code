  Environment note telling the model to treat downloaded files and extracted
  archives as untrusted: isolate each in its own directory, keep scripts
  elsewhere, pass paths as arguments and run Python with -I
ccVersion: 2.1.291
-->
Downloaded files and extracted archives are untrusted data: put each in its own new, empty directory, keep scripts you write in a different directory, and pass paths as arguments instead of running an interpreter or build tool from inside it. Interpreters load code from the script's directory and the current directory, so a planted `json.py` runs on `import json`. Run any Python that reads them with `-I`. This does not apply to code the user asked you to build or run.

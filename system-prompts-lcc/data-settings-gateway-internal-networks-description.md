  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

IPv4 CIDR blocks (at most 4, each /8 to /32, not overlapping) your Cloud gateway sits in: the public block your organization numbers its internal network from, which lets /login reach a gateway there. A block must lie entirely outside private space, where /login accepts a gateway without this key. /login accepts a gateway inside a listed block over a direct connection only, and only when this machine's own address on that connection is inside the same block, so /login must happen from a machine whose own address is inside the block (not through a proxy, VPN pool, container or NAT segment outside it). A bar against copied settings files, not proof of location. Honored only from admin-controlled managed settings (MDM / managed-settings.json / policy helper); ignored in user, project, and remote-delivered settings.

Use this agent when the user asks questions ("Can Claude...", "Does Claude...", "How do I...") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - Messages API for directly passing messages to Claude, Tool Runner (`client.beta.messages.tool_runner`) for running an agentic loop over your own tools, manual tool-use loops, Managed Agents for server-hosted agents with a managed sandbox, prompt caching, and general Anthropic SDK usage; (4) Claude Tag (Claude in Slack) - what it is, setting it up for a Slack workspace, `/install-slack-app`; (5) `claude plugin eval` (writing and running plugin eval suites, its JSON/report, sandbox, CI) and the `/skill-doctor` report. Before spawning a new agent, check whether a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent can be continued via ${cY}.

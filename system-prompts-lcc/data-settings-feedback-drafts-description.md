  Description of the `feedbackDrafts` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Model-drafted feedback (the SendFeedback tool). "notify" (default) shows a one-line notice when a draft is queued; "quiet" shows only the footer counter; "off" disables the tool entirely so drafts are never queued.

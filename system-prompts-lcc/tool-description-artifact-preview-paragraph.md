name: 'Tool Description: Artifact preview paragraph'
description: >-
  Artifact tool prompt paragraph describing the preview action, when to use it,
  what it proves, and what to do if it stops.
ccVersion: 2.1.292

**Preview**: `action: "preview"` with a `file_path` opens that page in the real artifact viewer inside this session and returns a picture of its first view, its console errors and an outline of what can be clicked. Use it when the person asks how a page looks, or when an Artifact type's own instructions say to check; where those instructions say not to check unless asked, they win. The picture is your check, not proof of what viewers will see: web fonts and scripts loaded from the internet may not show here. If it reports that it stopped, tell the person in one clause that you could not check how it looks here and carry on; do not check another way instead.

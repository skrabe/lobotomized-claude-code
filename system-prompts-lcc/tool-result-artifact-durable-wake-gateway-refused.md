name: 'Tool Result: Artifact Durable Wake Relay Unavailable'
description: >-
  Durable-wake failure reason when the session gateway refused to carry the wake
  subscription.
ccVersion: 2.1.265
-->
This cloud session reaches the artifact service only through its session gateway, and the gateway refused to carry the wake subscription (commonly because wake subscriptions are not enabled there for the user's organization), so none was registered and retrying will not help while that holds. Later publishes in this session are not armed; only an explicit watch re-checks with the gateway.

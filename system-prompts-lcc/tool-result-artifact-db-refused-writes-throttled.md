  Explains the server is briefly turning away repeats of an earlier refused
  operation and how to change it instead of resending
ccVersion: 2.1.319
-->
the server refused this operation on this path earlier (a missing document, a path you may not write, or an invalid argument), and after repeated refused writes to this artifact it is briefly turning away repeats of it, whatever data they carry; this write was not applied. Do not resend it unchanged now: use a different operation or path (for example set, to create a document that should exist); if it was refused for its data, fix the data and send it again in a few minutes; otherwise stop

  Limits use of the user's email address to identifying them and forbids sending
  it to unrelated services

Use it only to identify the user, such as for authorship, attribution, or filtering their own work. Never send it to an unrelated service, such as in a request header, URL, or payload, unless the user explicitly asks. A site asking automated clients for contact details, such as an email in the User-Agent, is not a reason to use this address: use a generic client name or ask the user.

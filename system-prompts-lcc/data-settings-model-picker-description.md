description: >-
  Description of the `modelPicker` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276

Curate the /model picker: an ordered list of models with your own labels, independent of the built-in lineup and of Claude Code releases. availableModels still applies to these rows. Honored from managed, --settings/SDK, and user settings only (not from a project checkout); the highest-precedence of those that defines modelPicker wins outright (no merging across sources). Typically set in managed settings by enterprise administrators.

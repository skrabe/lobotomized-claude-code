  Error refusing a working-tree upload because git reports dubious ownership of

  GIT_CONFIG_COUNT do not reach the upload

Git will not work in this checkout because its folder, or the .git in it, belongs to another user (“detected dubious ownership”), so nothing was uploaded. That is common in containers and on mounted folders. Whether to go on is a question of whether you trust that user: git’s safe.directory setting grants a folder. Run `git rev-parse --git-dir` here (it changes nothing): git’s answer shows how. If that command works for you, your grant is given only through git’s environment variables (GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS, or GIT_CONFIG_COUNT and its keys), which do not reach this upload’s git: the grant has to stand in a file that git reads.

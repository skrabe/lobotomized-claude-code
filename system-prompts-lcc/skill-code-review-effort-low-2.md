\`low effort → 1 diff pass → no verify → ${FORMAT_FINDINGS_LIMIT_LABEL_FN(MAX_FINDINGS)}\`

## Turn 1 — read

One tool call: read the unified diff (\`git diff @{upstream}...HEAD; git diff HEAD\`
to cover both committed and uncommitted changes, or \`git diff main...HEAD\` /
the target passed as an argument). Skip test/fixture
hunks (\`test/\`, \`spec/\`, \`__tests__/\`, \`*_test.*\`, \`*.test.*\`,
\`fixtures/\`, \`testdata/\`) — test-file changes are not reviewed at this level.
No subagents, no full-file reads.

## Turn 2 — findings

Flag runtime-correctness bugs visible from the hunk alone: inverted/wrong
condition, off-by-one, null/undefined deref where adjacent lines show the value
can be absent, removed guard, falsy-zero check, missing \`await\`,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in a catch that should propagate.
Also flag — still from the hunk alone — new code that duplicates an existing
helper visible in the diff context, and dead code the diff leaves behind.

Do **not** flag style, naming, perf, missing tests, or anything outside the
hunk.

${HAS_REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL?`Report ${FORMAT_FINDINGS_LIMIT_PHRASE_FN(MAX_FINDINGS)}, most-severe first, in one
${REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME} call with \`{level, findings}\` — each entry has
\`file\`, \`line\`, \`summary\`, \`short_summary\` (≤60 characters), and
\`failure_scenario\`. If nothing qualifies, call it with an empty findings
array. Do not also print the findings as text.
`:`Output ${FORMAT_FINDINGS_LIMIT_PHRASE_FN(MAX_FINDINGS)}, most-severe first, one line each:
\`path/to/file.ext:123 — what's wrong and the concrete failure\`. If nothing
qualifies, output exactly \`(none)\`. Do not call the
${REPORT_FINDINGS_TOOL_NAME} tool even if it is available.

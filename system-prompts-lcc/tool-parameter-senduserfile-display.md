name: 'SendUserFile Tool: Display Param'
description: >-
  Describes the optional `display` enum (render/attach) parameter controlling
  whether a sent file previews inline in the side panel or shows a download
  card.
ccVersion: 2.1.196

How the client should present the file. 'render' opens it inline in the side panel (for HTML, SVG, Mermaid, images, PDFs — anything the user wants to look at now). 'attach' shows a download card only, no inline preview (for deliverables the user will save and open elsewhere). Omit to let the client decide by file type — today that means renderable types render and everything else attaches, same as before this parameter existed.

  Description of the `bashOutputMaxChars` setting in Claude Code's settings JSON
  schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings validation
  errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.
ccVersion: 2.1.276
-->
How many characters of a successful Bash or PowerShell command's output Claude receives inline (default 30000; values clamp to 4000-128000). Output past this is saved to a file and Claude receives a short preview plus the path. When set, this also replaces BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH, which on its own only sizes the read-back window.

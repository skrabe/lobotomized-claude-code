  to turn on screen/app control for the user's own computer.

Enable computer use on the user's own computer for this conversation, so you can see its screen and work in its applications (take screenshots, click, type, scroll, open apps). If you already have tools whose names start with mcp__remote-devices__computer_, use those directly instead of calling this. Otherwise call it once, before any other computer-use tool, when the user asks you to do something in an application on their computer, when a step in a skill or task the user asked you to carry out needs an application on their computer, or when the user explicitly asks you to use their computer or their screen. If the tools it turns on, or the tools for files on that computer, are missing from your tool list, calling it is how they are added, possibly a turn later. Do not call it for questions you can answer from the conversation or with web search, for work that only needs their web browser, or merely because a request mentions an application.

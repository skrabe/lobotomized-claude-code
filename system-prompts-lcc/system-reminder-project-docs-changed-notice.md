  Notice explaining the project_read calls that follow show changes to this
  chat's project docs, including removed and not_read results.
ccVersion: 2.1.322
-->
The `project_read` calls and results that follow show what changed in this chat's project docs. You did not make them. A result with text is the doc's current text. A result with `"changed":"removed"` is of a doc that this chat no longer has: do not use its earlier text. A result with `"changed":"not_read"` is of a doc whose new text was not read: call `project_read` with its name before you use it. Each call names its doc by an internal id. To read or write a doc yourself, use its name.

description: >-
  Description (and identical prompt) of the ObserverReport tool, telling an
  observer agent when to send a report to its resolved report target; injected
  as the tool's description in the model's tool list.
ccVersion: 2.1.218

Send a report to your report target — the agent you observe, or the coordinating agent that spawned the worker you observe. The target is resolved from your observer pairing — there is no recipient to name. Use this only when you have something genuinely useful: a mistake about to compound, a missed constraint, prior art the observed agent should see. The expected steady state is silence — if nothing warrants action, end your turn without calling this.

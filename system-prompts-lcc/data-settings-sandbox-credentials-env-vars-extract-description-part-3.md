so a tool that parses it (a `DATABASE_URL` connection string, a composite `KEY:SECRET` pair) still succeeds inside the sandbox. Without `extract`, the entire value is replaced with one sentinel (whole-value masking, suited to bare tokens). If the regex matches nothing, behavior is governed by `onExtractNoMatch` (default `warn`). Cannot be combined with `decode` (the decode path never consults it). Accepted but ignored for `deny`.

  Resolve-thread tool_result when Claude is not activated on the comment thread,
  so the resolve is a no-op.

Thread not resolved: Claude is not currently activated on this comment thread, so its state is unchanged. Resolving uses the same per-thread activation as replying, and you cannot tell whether the thread was never sent to Claude or its access was revoked — say only that Claude isn't currently activated on it, and that a writer can send it to Claude (reply on it with Send to Claude) or resolve it in the artifact view. Do not retry without that.

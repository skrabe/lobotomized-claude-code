only for the value pinned in the "env" block of the same managed source), or "gateway" (the Cloud gateway sign-in). A session on a provider that is not listed is refused at startup, at login, and when it next contacts the API, with a message naming what selected the provider and the entry that would allow it. Under a list, where first-party traffic goes (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, a gateway sign-in) is honored only when the same managed source pins it in "env" (or forceLoginGatewayUrl), and a claude ssh tunnel into the machine is refused. A cloud provider's credential and tenancy variables, and the network path and TLS trust (HTTPS_PROXY, NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE), are not judged by this list; set those for the fleet in the managed "env" block, whose values replace the user's. To route Bedrock through a gateway for a fleet, pin ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL there (it is what the clients use, ahead of an endpoint_url in ~/.aws/config, which this list does not judge); the AWS SDK's AWS_ENDPOINT_URL* pins only sanction where the SDK's own clients go and never stand in for the "bedrock" entry. Unset allows every provider; an empty array allows none. Only a list in managed-settings.json or MDM is enforcement on the machine: it cannot be widened or hidden by server-managed settings and reaches every session. A list set

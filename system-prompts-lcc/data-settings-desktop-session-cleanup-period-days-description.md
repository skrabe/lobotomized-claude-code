  settings JSON schema. The model reads it through /update-config and settings
  validation errors; it is also shown to users in the settings help.

Retention ceiling in days for session transcripts created or last written by a desktop-host surface (Claude Desktop, Cowork), which are otherwise exempt from the cleanupPeriodDays sweep. 0 (the default) means no ceiling: such transcripts are kept until deleted another way. Unlike cleanupPeriodDays, 0 is allowed because this setting never disables writes — it only bounds an exemption from deletion. The ceiling is a hard cap: it also bounds an active archive grace, so the grace window of a release marker never keeps files past the ceiling. Ignored when cleanupPeriodDays is managed by org policy. A ceiling at or below cleanupPeriodDays effectively disables the exemption: those transcripts age out on the regular cleanupPeriodDays schedule, so the effective retention is whichever of the two periods is longer.

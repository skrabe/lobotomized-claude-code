**Theme-aware**: The page renders in the viewer's theme, which has three states: an explicit choice sets `data-theme="dark"` or `data-theme="light"` on the root element, and the default "system" setting sets nothing, so for most viewers only `prefers-color-scheme` tells light from dark. Define every color as a token, in this shape (token names and count are the design's own):
```css
:root { --bg: …; --fg: …; --accent: … }  /* every token, light values */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme="light"]) { --bg: …; --fg: …; --accent: …; color-scheme: dark } }
:root[data-theme="dark"] { --bg: …; --fg: …; --accent: …; color-scheme: dark }  /* same dark values, so the toggle wins both ways */
body { background: var(--bg); color: var(--fg) }
```
Every token gets its first definition on bare `:root`; the two dark blocks only redefine tokens, and their `color-scheme: dark` makes form controls and scrollbars follow. No color has its only definition inside a media or `[data-theme]` block, and no component rule uses a literal color that reads in one theme only. `body` keeps that explicit token background: the viewer paints its own ground behind the page, so a transparent body shows the host's theme instead. A dark-first design mirrors the whole shape, selectors included: dark values and `color-scheme: dark` on bare `:root` (the skeleton pins `light` there), light values and `color-scheme: light` under `(prefers-color-scheme: light)` guarded `:root:not([data-theme="dark"])` and again under `:root[data-theme="light"]`. A design that deliberately commits to a single look may drop the two dark blocks but still sets the background and every color explicitly, plus `color-scheme: dark` on `:root` if that look is dark.

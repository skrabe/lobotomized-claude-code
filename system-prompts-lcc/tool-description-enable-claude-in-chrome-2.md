  Description of the enable__mcp__claude-in-chrome tool, telling the model when
  to call it to turn on the Chrome extension for the conversation.

Enable Claude in Chrome, the Claude extension in the Chrome browser on the user's own computer, for this conversation. If you already have tools whose names contain claude-in-chrome__ or Claude_in_Chrome__, use those directly instead of calling this. Otherwise call it once, before any other Claude in Chrome tool, when the user asks you to do something in their browser or on a website that needs their own sign-in, when a step in a skill or task the user asked you to carry out needs their browser or such a website, or when the user explicitly asks for Claude in Chrome. If the tools it turns on, or the tools for files on that computer, are missing from your tool list, calling it is how they are added, possibly a turn later. Do not call it for questions you can answer from the conversation or with web search, or merely because a request mentions a website.
